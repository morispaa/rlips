This is OpenCL version of the rflips package. Givens rotations are done
in parallel using OpenCL. 


Installation
-------------

If you are using Mac OS X.7 (Lion) or later, you should be able to install 
this package in the normal way, i.e.

sudo R CMD INSTALL rlips


In Linux, if you have CUDA SDK and drivers installed, you should be able to install 
this package in the normal way, i.e.

sudo R CMD INSTALL rlips


If you have some other OpenCL implementation installed, you must modify the file

rlips/src/Makevars

accordingly. Sorry for the inconvience. We'll fix this at some point!
